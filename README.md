Kapok
==========

Kapok is a dynamic, functional, general-purpose programming language. It's a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Kapok leverages the Erlang VM, which known for running low-latency, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

Kapok is designed with goals as the belowing:

1. Be a modern lisp with similiar syntax as Clojure
1. keep max compactible to the Erlang ecosystem
1. Supports protocol, lazy interfaces
1. Provides a rich set of useful libraries, in terms of unicode string, file, networt
1. Shipped with powerful tools, e.g. project management tool, editor integration

Currently kapok is under heavy development. It's not stable and incoming change is expectable. Please don't use it in production environment.

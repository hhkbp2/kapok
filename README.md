Kapok
==========

Kapok is a dynamic, functional, general-purpose programming language. It's a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Kapok leverages the Erlang VM, which known for running low-latency, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

Kapok is designed with goals as the belowing:

1. Be a modern lisp with similiar syntax as Clojure and keep max compactible to the Erlang ecosystem
2. Supports unicode string, protocol, lazy interfaces
3. Provides a rich set of useful libraries and powerful tools

Currently kapok is under heavy development. It's not stable and incoming change is expectable. Please don't use it in production environment.

Kapok
==========

Kapok is a dynamic, functional, general-purpose programming language. It's a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Kapok leverages the Erlang VM, which known for running low-latency, scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

Kapok is designed with goals as below:

1. Has syntax like Clojure
1. Keep max compatible with the Erlang ecosystem
1. Be compatible with Elixir to leverage its protocol, lazy interfaces, and a rich set of useful libraries, in terms of unicode string, file, network, etc.
1. (TODO)Shipped with powerful tools, e.g. project management tool, editor integration, etc.
